Hello, and welcome to my website. Perhaps you are reading this because you are experiencing difficulties and you are looking for support. When we experience emotional or personal problems, trying to deal with them alone can be challenging and painful. Sometimes it can be helpful to talk to someone who is not directly involved in our daily lives. 

Issues that people come to talk to me about include: relationship concerns, depression, anxiety, and difficulties at work or place of study. In addition, one of my interests is in helping people who are leaving coercive environments, such as sects: I frequently work with those who have experienced high degrees of control within fundamentalist and evangelical groups. I have posted some resources that ex-members may find useful on this website.
